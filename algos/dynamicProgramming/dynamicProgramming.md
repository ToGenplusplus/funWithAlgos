# Dynamic Programming

- Optimization Technique
- Its a way to solve a problem by braking it down into a collection of sub problems (divide & conquer) and solving
  each of those sub problems once and storing their solutions in case the sub problem occurs again (Memoization).
- Memoization
  - specific form of caching.
  - Cache the return value of a function based on its inout parameters.
- Examples
  - computing the fibonnaci number for a given number N.
